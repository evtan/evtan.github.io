    <b>Hi, I'm Evan</b>
    <p> Having worked with many startups making a difference through building great products and using data, I enjoy finding
    ways to use software and data to help action-takers operationalise their visions, to do meaningful work
    and build purposeful careers.
    <p>I'm currently Chief of Staff at <a class="link" style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank" href="https://holistics.io/">
    Holistics Software</a>, a full-stack data analytics platform ranked #2 globally by Gartner's FrontRunners in 2019. As a self-taught coder and product leader,
    I have been a key member of the core team, driving market engagements and outcomes for customers. You can watch some of my
    <a class="link" style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POhcv45-jh0">product videos here</a>!
    <p> Previously I worked as a Research Associate at the
      <a class="link" style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank" href="https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/aci">Asia Competitiveness Institute</a> at the
      Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, one of the world's leading economic policy think-tanks applying quantitative methods to study Asian economies.
    I graduated with my masterâ€™s degree from Melbourne Business School in 2014, where I was
    actively involved with the <a class="link" style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank" href="https://cainz.org/">CAINZ commerce student organisation</a> as President, and worked closely
    with the Faculty of Business and Economics Careers Centre and industry partners to develop programs for students.
