    <b>Hi, I'm Evan</b>
    <p>I'm currently Chief of Staff at Holistics Software, a full-stack data analytics
    platform ranked #2 globally by Gartner's FrontRunners in 2019.
    <p> Having worked with many startups making a difference through building great products and using data, I enjoy finding
    ways to use software and data to help action-takers operationalise their visions, to do meaningful work
    and build purposeful careers.
    <p> Previously I worked as a Research Associate at the Asia Competitiveness Institute, a global
    top 20 economic policy think-tank applying quantitative methods to study Asian economies.
    I graduated with my masterâ€™s degree from Melbourne Business School in 2014, where I was
    actively involved with the CAINZ student organisation as President, and worked closely
    with the Faculty of Business and Economics Careers Centre and industry partners
    to develop programs for students.
    <p> I have also taught myself to code using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, R and SQL. I coded this site
    on Ruby using Middleman Blog and Github Pages.
