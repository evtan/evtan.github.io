<p>I was recently listening to an interview with  <a class="link" style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank" href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-james-hollis-how-to-find-your-true-purpose-create-your-best-life">Dr James Hollis</a>, who talked about finding purpose and managing transitions in life. He talked about the concepts and work of Carl Jung, which struck a chord with me. I&rsquo;ve since read Jung&rsquo;s book Man and His Symbols, and am noting down some of the key concepts here, which resonate with me at this stage of life that I am at now. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Individuation</strong>: In the book Man and His Symbols, one of the definitions provided by von Franz suggests that the actual process of individuation entails &ldquo;the conscious coming-to-terms with one&rsquo;s own inner center (psychic nucleus) or Self&rdquo; (p.166). At the risk of oversimplifying, I would interpret the process of individuation to be a journey to reach psychic wholeness, through integration of the ego-consciousness with the unconscious.</li>
<li><strong>Ego</strong>: Contrary to current popular use, Jung seems to broadly define the ego as consciousness. The ego is required in order to integrate the contents of the unconscious, and to undergo the process of individuation. This is where cultural mythologies are able to aid in &ldquo;the development of the individual&rsquo;s ego-consciousness—his awareness of his own strengths and weaknesses—in a manner that will equip him for the arduous tasks with which life confronts him&rdquo; (p.112).</li>
<li><strong>Unconscious</strong>: A complex concept, there are several guiding ideas that can help portray the nature of the unconscious. It is suggested that the unconscious is &ldquo;a natural phenomenon producing symbols that prove to be meaningful&rdquo; (p.102). Elsewhere in the book, it is suggested that the symbol-making propensity of humans &ldquo;unconsciously transforms objects or forms into symbols (thereby endowing them with great psychological importance)&rdquo; and expresses them in both religion and visual art (p.232). The influence of the unconscious upon us as individuals finds regular expression in the instinctual drives and &ldquo;autonomous emotions erupting from the unconscious&rdquo; (p.237). And intriguingly, Jung and his collaborators observed that an individual &ldquo;produces symbols unconsciously and spontaneously, in the form of dreams&rdquo; (p.21). Paraphrasing a useful quote from Jung to understand the approximate nature of the unconscious, he suggests that until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct one&rsquo;s life and you will call it fate.</li>
</ul>

<p>I drew out this diagram based on the ideas and images I encountered in the book Man and His Symbols, to capture my understanding of the relationship between the ego-consciousness and the unconscious in an individual&rsquo;s psyche:</p>

<br><em>Representation of the psyche with the ego-consciousness and unconscious.</em></p>

<p>To me, the process of individuation is a journey towards meaning. A concept I derived from reading Viktor Frankl&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Man&rsquo;s Search For Meaning&rdquo; is the primacy of the will to meaning.  Many of us are familiar with the notion of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs, which places actualisation at the top of the pyramid, which could be taken to imply that meaning and purpose are a luxury compared to our basic needs. However, a powerful insight that Frankl put forward in his book observed that in the concentration camps, the individuals who were likeliest to survive were those that had meaning to live for, while a pattern of behaviour was observed in those whose &ldquo;meaning orientation had subsided&rdquo;, where they eventually gave up and succumbed in a matter of hours under the extreme conditions. This left a deep impression upon me, that effectively; Meaning is of primary importance, and not secondary.</p>

<p>I find this poem by Mary Oliver captures this notion of the journey of individuation beautifully:</p>

<h3 id="the-journey-by-mary-oliver">The Journey by Mary Oliver</h3>

<p><em>One day you finally knew
<br>what you had to do, and began,
<br>though the voices around you
<br>kept shouting
<br>their bad advice—
<br>though the whole house
<br>began to tremble
<br>and you felt the old tug
<br>at your ankles.
<br>&ldquo;Mend my life!&rdquo;
<br>each voice cried.
<br>But you didn&rsquo;t stop.
<br>You knew what you had to do,
<br>though the wind pried
<br>with its stiff fingers
<br>at the very foundations,
<br>though their melancholy
<br>was terrible.
<br>It was already late
<br>enough, and a wild night,
<br>and the road full of fallen
<br>branches and stones.
<br>But little by little,
<br>as you left their voices behind,
<br>the stars began to burn
<br>through the sheets of clouds,
<br>and there was a new voice
<br>which you slowly
<br>recognized as your own,
<br>that kept you company
<br>as you strode deeper and deeper
<br>into the world,
<br>determined to do
<br>the only thing you could do—
<br>determined to save
<br>the only life you could save.</em></p>
